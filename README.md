# code-refactor

## Description
This projct was made to rewrite code to help design it in a more logical sense using semantic tags without changing the appearance of the page.

## Installation
I took out the old tags that were not decriptive and rplaced them with semantic tags that are better for understanding the structure of the page. 

## Usage
